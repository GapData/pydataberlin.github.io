Artists, designers, and other creatives can share their work easily on the internet, but keeping it as \"theirs\" and get fairly compensated has proven difficult. How do you \"own\" something when bits can be copied freely? It turns out that visionaries of hypertext foresaw this issue in the 60s. They even proposed systems to handle this. However, those systems were too complex and hard to build. By the early 90s, the simpler WWW had won, but unfortunately in its simplicity it left out attribution to owners. We ask a new question: can we retrofit the internet for ownership? It turns out the answer is yes, with the help of python-powered big data, machine learning, and the blockchain. First, we crawl the internet and create a large scale crawl database, then preprocess all media into machine learning features. Then, creators can \"register\" their work onto the blockchain. Finally, we use machine learning to cross-reference registered works against the large-scale crawl database. We can do this for images, text, and even 3d designs; and it works even if the design has changed meaningfully. Python-powered big data is making it possible to revive the dream of ownership on the internet.",

Blosc was originally conceived to mitigate the problem of starving CPUs which results from the ever growing divide between clock speed and memory latency. Recently, it has become increasingly useful for other scenarios too, for example, out-of-core approaches and compressed in-memory storage.  Blosc has a small codebase and is implemented in C. Additionally, several pieces of interesting software, largely written in Python, have emerged that make use of Blosc, showcasing it's potential and exploring the new use-cases.

        "abstract": "Although not exactly a classical big data application, the numerical treatment of partial differential equations (PDEs) has very similar characteristics: By spatial discretization, the continuous problem is translated to linear systems and the discrete solution is represented by a vector of floating point numbers. Depending on the dimensions of the domain and the granularity of the spatial discretization, the size of the arising matrices and vectors may range from a few thousands to billions of entries. Usual operations include matrix-vector multiplications, the solution of linear systems and more complicated tasks like the solution of eigenvalue problems.<br><br>Due to usually large problem sizes, computational performance is certainly a main design goal of PDE solvers. However, when it comes to the implementation of complex PDEs or algorithms in general it is equally desirable to use high level programming tools that allow a concise domain-related problem definition.<br><br>Recently, Python gained a lot of attention in the scientific computing community that was dominated by compiled languages as Fortran and C for a long time. The reason for this development is most likely the fulfillment of the above mentioned criteria: performance and brief syntax. While the brief syntax is a feature of the language itself, Python owes its high performance the existence of excellent third party libraries such as NumPy. Many novel scientific special purpose libraries are still written in compiled languages, but come with Python wrappers and seamlessly integrate with NumPy.<br><br>The aim of this talk is to give a brief introduction to the problem domain and present a selection of Python tools and libraries for scientific computing with a focus on continuous problems.",

Usually, the code produced by the Data Scientist is a bunch of scripts that go from data loading over data cleansing to feature extraction and then model training. There is rarely much thought put into how the resulting model can be used by other pieces of software and this is generally not a good practice of encapsulating the Data Scientist's work for others to re-use.<br><br>What we as Data Scientists want is to create models that drive automated decision-making but there is clearly a mismatch to the above way of going about Big Data projects. Considering these challenges, we created a small prototype for a Data Science operationalization framework. This allows the Data Scientist to implement a model which is exposed by the framework as a REST API for easy access by software developers.<br><br>The difference to other predictive APIs is that this framework allows for automatic periodic retraining of the implemented model on incoming streaming data and is able to free the Data Scientist of some tedious work - like \u0178keeping track of results for different modelling and feature engineering approaches, basic visualization of model performance and the creation of multiple model instances for different data streams. It is written by practitioning Data Scientists for Data Scientists.<br><br>Moreover, the framework will be released this year under an Open Source license which means that unlike other predictive APIs which only host one instance for Data Scientists to push their models to, this allows Data Scientists to completely control their own model codebase. In addition, it is deployable on Cloud Foundry and Heroku and can thus use some features of PaaS, which means less work in thinking about how to deploy and scale a model in production. <br><br>The model is implemented in Python and uses Flask to expose the REST API and the current prototype uses Redis as backend storage for the trained models. Models can be either custom-written or use existing Python ML libraries like scikit-learn. The framework is currently geared towards online learning, but it is possible to hook it up to a Spark backend to realize model training in batch on large datasets.",

Traditionally, classification methods aim at minimizing the misclassification of examples, in which an example is misclassified if the predicted class is different from the true class. Such a traditional framework assumes that all misclassification errors carry the same cost. This is not the case in many real-world applications such as credit card fraud detection, credit scoring, churn modeling and direct marketing. In this talk I would like to present CostCla a cost-sensitive classification library. The library incorporates several cost-sensitive algorithms. Moreover, during the talk I will show the huge differences in profit when using traditional machine learning algorithms versus cost-sensitive algorithms, on several real-world databases.",
